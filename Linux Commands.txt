File exists until all hard links are removed

🔹Soft Link 

Has a different inode number
Points to the file path, not the inode

setfacl -d -m u:user:rwx dir → Sets default ACL so new files inherit permissions

🔹ACL Key Points::
ACL provides additional permissions beyond standard chmod
ACL works along with basic permissions (not a full replacement)
Effective permissions depend on both ACL and standard permissions
ACL is useful when multiple users need different access levels.

One-line workflow:
====================
lsblk → parted/fdisk → mkpart → lsblk → mkfs → mkdir → mount → blkid → fstab → mount -a


📌NFS Server:
mount | grep /data --> Confirms the filesystem is mounted and ready to be exported via NFS.
sudo apt install -y nfs-kernel-server(or: sudo dnf install -y nfs-utils) --> Installs NFS server packages.
systemctl status nfs-server --> Verifies NFS service is available.
sudo chown -R nobody:nogroup /data(or: chown -R user:group /data) --> Sets ownership for NFS client access.
sudo chmod 755 /data -->Sets directory permissions for sharing.
sudo vim /etc/exports -->Opens the NFS export configuration file.
/data 192.168.1.0/24(rw,sync,no_subtree_check) -->Exports /data to the specified network.
sudo exportfs -ra -->Applies NFS export rules.
sudo exportfs -v  -->Displays active NFS exports for confirmation.
sudo systemctl enable --now nfs-server -->Starts NFS service and enables it on boot.
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=nfs
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
(or: sudo ufw allow nfs) -->Allows NFS traffic through the firewall.

📌 NFS CLIENT
sudo apt install -y nfs-common(or: sudo dnf install -y nfs-utils) -->Installs NFS client utilities.
showmount -e SERVER_IP -->Lists available NFS exports from the server.
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/data -->Creates a mount point for the NFS share.
sudo mount -t nfs SERVER_IP:/data /mnt/data -->Temporarily mounts the NFS share.
touch /mnt/data/.test && rm /mnt/data/.test -->Verifies read/write access on the NFS mount.
sudo vim /etc/fstab  -->Opens fstab for persistent NFS mount configuration.
SERVER_IP:/data /mnt/data nfs defaults,_netdev 0 0   -->Ensures the NFS share mounts automatically after reboot.
sudo umount /mnt/data && sudo mount -a  -->Tests persistent NFS mount without reboot.

LVM PARTITION:
LVM (Logical Volume Manager) allows flexible disk management by abstracting physical storage.

Physical Volume (PV) → A disk or partition initialized for LVM
Volume Group (VG) → A pool of storage created from one or more PVs
Logical Volume (LV) → Virtual partition created from VG space

Basic flow:
Disk/Partition → PV → VG → LV → Filesystem → Mount point

LVM Creation::
lsblk → Lists all disks and partitions to identify the correct target disk

sudo parted /dev/nvme1n1 print → Displays existing partition layout as a dry-run

sudo parted /dev/nvme1n1 --align optimal → Opens parted with optimal alignment for SSD/NVMe

mklabel gpt → Creates a GPT partition table (destroys existing layout)

mkpart primary 1MiB 100% → Creates a single partition for LVM use

set 1 lvm on → Marks the partition type as LVM

print → Displays the partition table for confirmation

quit → Exits parted after verification

lsblk /dev/nvme1n1 → Confirms the kernel detects the new partition

pvcreate /dev/nvme1n1p1 → Initializes the partition as an LVM Physical Volume

vgcreate vg_data /dev/nvme1n1p1 → Creates a Volume Group named vg_data

vgdisplay → Displays Volume Group details

lvcreate -n lv_data -l 100%FREE vg_data → Creates a Logical Volume using all free space

lvdisplay → Displays Logical Volume details

mkfs.xfs /dev/vg_data/lv_data → Formats the Logical Volume with XFS

mkdir -p /data → Creates a mount point

mount /dev/vg_data/lv_data /data → Temporarily mounts the Logical Volume

touch /data/.test && rm /data/.test → Verifies read/write access

blkid /dev/vg_data/lv_data → Displays UUID of the Logical Volume

vim /etc/fstab → Opens fstab for permanent mount configuration

UUID=xxxx /data xfs defaults,nofail,noatime 0 2 → Ensures persistent mount across reboots

umount /data && mount -a → Tests permanent mount without reboot.

🔼 LVM EXTEND

lsblk → Displays disks and partitions to identify free space or new disks

pvcreate /dev/nvme2n1 → Initializes a new disk or partition as a Physical Volume

vgextend vg_data /dev/nvme2n1 → Adds the new Physical Volume to an existing Volume Group

vgdisplay vg_data → Shows updated Volume Group size and free space

lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/vg_data/lv_data → Extends the Logical Volume using all free VG space

xfs_growfs /data → Expands the XFS filesystem online without unmounting

df -h /data → Verifies the filesystem size increase

🔽 LVM REDUCE (EXT4 ONLY ⚠️)

df -h /data → Checks current filesystem usage

umount /data → Unmounts the filesystem before shrinking

e2fsck -f /dev/vg_data/lv_data → Checks filesystem integrity

resize2fs /dev/vg_data/lv_data 50G → Shrinks the filesystem to the desired size

lvreduce -L 50G /dev/vg_data/lv_data → Reduces the Logical Volume size

mount /data → Mounts the filesystem back

df -h /data → Verifies the reduced filesystem size

🚫 IMPORTANT NOTE

xfs → Cannot be reduced (shrink not supported)
ext4 → Can be safely reduced offline.
