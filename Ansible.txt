configuration management:
==========================
provision server -->baseline it according to our needs like customization

1.installing programming language
2.creating users and folder
3.installing system packages
4.download code
5.installing dependecies
6.creating systemctl services
7. enable and starting the services

the above all steps will call it as configuration

Configuration management tools:
chef,saltstack,puppet,ansible,CFEngine

Pull vs Push::
===============
Push Model:
Controller pushes configuration to nodes
The central server initiates the connection
It sends configs/commands directly to target machines
Targets don’t need to ask for anything

How it works
Controller  ───►  Node1
             ───►  Node2
             ───►  Node3


Pros:
Fast execution
Easy to control and debug
No agent always running on nodes (often)

Cons
Harder to scale for very large infrastructures
Controller needs network access to all nodes

Pull Model:
-----------
Nodes pull configuration from the server
Each node initiates the connection
Nodes periodically check the server and pull updates

How it works
Node1 ──► Controller
Node2 ──► Controller
Node3 ──► Controller

Pros:
Highly scalable
More secure (nodes reach out, controller doesn’t need access)
Good for large, distributed systems

Cons:
Changes may not apply instantly (depends on polling interval)
Slightly harder to debug timing issues

Authentication requirements:
protocol
port
username
password

ansible all -i 172.31.26.110, -e ansible_user=ec2-user -e ansible_password=devops321 -m ping -->connect to node and perform operations.
-m -->modules/collections
ansible all -i 172.31.26.110, -e ansible_user=ec2-user -e ansible_password=devops321 -b -m dnf -a "name=nginx state=installed" -->to install nginx with root
