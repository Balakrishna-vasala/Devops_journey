How to give sudo access to user?
Ans:we have sudoers(/etc/sudoers) file where we can add,edit,delete acessess to users and also we can add user into wheel group.
%wheel    ALL=(ALL)      ALL
ramesh    ALL=(ALL)      ALL
ramesh    ALL=(ALL)     /usr/bin/systemctl -->to give specific commands access 
visudo -c -->to check the syntax if any issues in sudoers file post changes.

If user left the organisation actions::
1.Lock him immidiately --> usermod -L username
2.Remove user from all groups -->gpasswd -d username groupname
3.Take backup of his home /dir -->tar or Zip
4.Delete the user -->userdel username


Expense project::

package.json -->this is called build file where devlopers mention dependencies and application details
npm -->npm package manager -->build tool

Libraries       Nodejs              java              python                     DotNET
Extension      .js                 .java             .py 						 .net/.aspx
Build file      pacakage.json       pom.xml           requirements.txt			 *.csproj
Build tool     npm                 maven             pip						 nuget

.service file -->/etc/systemd/system -->*.service


Production Drill Session::
1.Capacity issues -->CPU,RAM,Disk,Connections,Queue,IOps
2.Config Drift -->Secrets,Routing,IAM roles
3.Dependencies failing -->Upstream vs downstream(DB down,Cache,DNS,LB,Gateway)
4.Deployment Issues -->Incompatible versions,schema mismatch,crash loops
5.Process failures -->Manual mistakes,Missing alerts.
